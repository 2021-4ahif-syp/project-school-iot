== Project Title
School-IoT

== Project Client
HTL Leonding

== Project Background
Due to the tendency of decreasing air quality in the classrooms, which leads to poorer learning quality
the IoT - Smart School project was launched in 2019. This was intended to improve air quality
of the classes and make pupils aware of poor air quality. Incorrect or continuous ventilation
can increase heating costs unnecessarily. It also happens more often that in classrooms the windows have been forgotten
and these are open for a longer period, unless the school caretaker or cleaning staff close.

== Project Result
Until now, we haven't been told what our tasks for this project will be, because this project was already been made
by a few other classes, so we expect that we have to improve the project or add new features.

== Project Goals
The IoT - Smart School is a project that aims to improve the quality of life in classrooms while reducing costs.

== Milestones
* Get existing work running
* Learn to use Mosquitto for MQTT Broker

== Project Start
We will start to work on this project on Monday, 2020-10-12. A few other teams worked on this project before.

== Project End
The expected end of the project is the end of the fifth grade (2022).
